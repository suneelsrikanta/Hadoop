# Hadoop_Amazon_Product_Reviews ( Spam and Non-Spam )
------------------------------------------------------
Introduction
A Hadoop cluster and Hive processing were used for all of the analysis in this repository. Analyzing spam and non-spam reviews in Hadoop involves utilizing its components like HDFS (Hadoop Distributed File System), MapReduce, and Apache Spark to handle, process, and extract insights from massive datasets. By using big data analysis businesses can quickly identify and address both spam and non-spam content by using big data platforms to analyze incoming reviews in real-time or almost real-time. This reduces the effect of fraudulent activity and maximizes the value of authentic reviews.
